In Campus Queue System
# About
This is a flutter based application where the admin can make queues and assign it to a cashier. The cashiers can access their respective queues and call for next orders so that the students dont have to wait in line to order. If a student who has booked queue, does not arrive and scan the qr on time, the cashier can call the next person in the queue. 

# Technologies Used
- Flutter
- Firebase (Database)
- Firestore Authentication
- Firestore Cloud Functions

# Note
- You will need to have knowledge of how to use and setup firestore functions if you are using the code from the repo.

- This is just a prototype so it might not be secure and work as intended
